# BugBuster AI - Advanced Code Bug Detection System

## Overview
BugBuster AI v2.0 is an enhanced system combining Parallel AST Processing, Knowledge Graph, Neural-Guided MCTS Search and Transformer-based models for superior bug detection.

## What's New in v2.0
- **Parallel Processing**: 2-4x faster analysis with parallel AST parsing
- **Type Inference**: More accurate detection with type-aware analysis
- **Persistent Knowledge Graph**: SQLite-backed storage for incremental analysis
- **Transformer Models**: State-of-the-art bug prediction and fix generation

## Current Implementation Status
The enhanced v2.0 framework includes:
- ✅ Parallel AST parser with type inference
- ✅ Persistent Knowledge Graph with incremental updates
- ✅ Neural-Guided MCTS search with parallel simulations
- ✅ Transformer-based neural models (policy, value, fix generator)
- ✅ Optimized CLI interface
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Key Features
- **Parallel Code Analysis**: Multi-threaded processing for large codebases
- **Type-Aware Detection**: Variable type inference for better accuracy
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only re-analyze changed code portions
- **Neural-Guided Search**: Transformer models direct bug search
- **Context-Aware Fixes**: Higher quality fix recommendations
- **Persistent Storage**: Maintain analysis results between runs

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the CLI: `python -m interfaces.cli.main path/to/file.py`

## Example Usage
```python
# Analyze with all v2.0 features
from bugbuster import analyze_code

# For large projects, use incremental mode
results = analyze_code("project/",
                      incremental=True,
                      use_gpu=True)  # Enable GPU acceleration

# Get detailed bug report
bugs = results.get_bugs(severity="high")
for bug in bugs:
    print(f"Bug at line {bug.line}: {bug.message}")
    print(f"Suggested fix: {bug.suggested_fix}")
    
# Save results for next analysis
results.save_knowledge_graph()
```
