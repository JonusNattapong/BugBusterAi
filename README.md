# BugBuster AI - Advanced Code Bug Detection System

## Overview
BugBuster AI is an advanced system that combines Enhanced MCTS with Neural Networks for multi-level temporal reasoning to detect, localize, and recommend fixes for code bugs.

## Key Features
- Multi-level bug detection (syntax → logic → runtime → performance)
- Knowledge Graph integration for code relationship mapping
- Temporal reasoning for execution flow modeling
- Adaptive MCTS for efficient bug search
- Neural networks for bug prediction, severity assessment, and fix generation
